Friends are more valuable than money. But friends with money — omg!
The only thing that comes between friends like us is the chocolate sitting on the table.
I’d follow you anywhere … on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter … anywhere!
A good friend is someone who’s got your back — and not waiting to stab you in it.
A fake friend stabs you in the back. A true friend pokes you in the back.
See You Tomorrow
On My Way
Never Mind
Send Me an Instant Message
Will You Call Me?
Be right Back
Are you done yet?
Bring your own beer
Crying in disgrace
Can’t stop laughing
See you later
Do I look like I give a sugar?
Doesn’t matter
Do you remember?
Good luck, have fun
I got to run
If you know what I mean
Okay, Okay!
Later
It’s ok
Seriously
What’s up?
Text back later
You’ve got to be kidding me
What?
Whatever
Who died and left you in charge?
What do you think?
This is a total waste of money, brains and time
Yes, I understand
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, whatever
